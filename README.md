# Readable Tarots [Balatro mod]  

Readable Tarots is a vanilla‑friendly Balatro resource pack that makes Tarot cards easier to understand at a glance.  

Each Tarot card has been visually adjusted using only existing in‑game assets. Symbols and/or backgrounds are added or emphasized to more clearly represent what each Tarot does, helping with faster decision‑making without breaking the original aesthetic of the game.
